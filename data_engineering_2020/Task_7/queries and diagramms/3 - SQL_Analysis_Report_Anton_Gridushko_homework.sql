-- 3. Formulate three the most valuable business questions (from your point of view) which could be resolved with information from Sales History.
-- â€¢ Compose text document which describes goals of your reports

From my point of view, the database solves the 3 most important aspects:

1. Costs
2. Profits
3. Target elements influencing the first two principles

According to these elements, I would ask the following questions:

1. Is your cash flow positive each month?

2. How does your business generate income?

3. Which parts of your business are not profitable?
