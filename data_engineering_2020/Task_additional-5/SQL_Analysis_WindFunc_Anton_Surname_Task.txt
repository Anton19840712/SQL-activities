-- Could you formulate the question more clearly?
-- What do you have in mind?
-- Amount or quantity?, or should I guess and demonstrate my soft skills at 22:00, asking what is at stake?
-- Vety fun.
-- Please, write more clearly what you want to receive in your request.
-- The fact is that I'm not completely sure what is wanted in this assignment... So I parsed the request this way and that...
-- After all this waste of time, I will not have time to make changes to this query. Thanks.
